            <h1>Welcome to Evalutron 6000</h1>
				<p>In order to use the Evalutron 6000 you will need a modern web browser that supports <strong>JavaScript, Flash, and Cookies</strong>. Evalutron has been tested on several popular browsers, and should work for you. If you are having trouble, please try another browser or machine. If you are still having difficulty, contact mirex@imirsel.org.</p>
				<p>If you have an account with the MIREX submission system, then you can use the same account for Evalutron 6000. Otherwise, you must register a new account. Click on the "Register" link to the left to create an account.</p>

			<h2>Walkthrough</h2>
				<p>There is a full walkthrough document available at: <a href="http://www.music-ir.org/mirex/wiki/2010:Evalutron6000_Walkthrough">http://www.music-ir.org/mirex/wiki/2010:Evalutron6000_Walkthrough</a>. Please read it prior to starting your evaluation.</p>
			
			<h2>Demo</h2>
				<p>If you want to see how E6K works, but aren't ready to commit to evaluating, <a href="demo.php">try the demo</a>. The demo has just 5 candidates to evaluate, and the results are not saved. (And yes, those are "real" results, from AMS 2009).</p>

			<h2>Important notices</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>This system is NOT open to the general public. Human subjects research regulations allow us to accept only graders who are part of the MIR and MDL community.</li>
				<li>Do NOT request assignments if you are merely curious to see how E6K works. You will disrupt the distribution of assignments to real graders. <strong><a href="demo.php">Try the E6K Demo</a> instead!</strong></li>
				<li>The Evalutron is set up for <strong>both</strong> Audio Music Similarity (AMS) task and Symbolic Melodic Similarity (SMS) task. Please be careful about what task you are selecting to evaluate for.</li>
				<li>Please do NOT create multiple accounts. If you can't log in, use the "Forgot Password" link found at the left menu.</li>
